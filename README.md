# Music Visualiser Assignment

This is a music visualiser created for the song “The Ketchup Song” by Aserejé. There are 5 sections in the song structurally, and each section has its creative visuals expressed through responsive and theme-oriented designs.  

The project aimed to create visuals that encapsulate and reflect the song’s structure, tempo and rhythm. In addition, demonstrated solid understanding and use of object-oriented programming, Java, Minim library and Processing library; teamwork and collaboration.

We choose this song as it was [top of the charts in 2002](https://top40-charts.com/chart.php?cid=31&date=2002-11-23), the year we were born.
We thought that the theme, and high energy of the song would be perfect for our music visualiser.

The idea of the song being called “The Ketchup Song” also would prove to be creative, in that we can create visuals related to ketchup. I.e., Tomatoes, vibrant colors.

The song has a narrow theme that we could really play with the visuals and be creative to express entertaining visuals

The song is about a young man named “Diego” who enters a nightclub while attempting to sing his favorite song “Rapper’s Delight” by the Sugarhill Gang. His Spanish gibberish imitation of that song makes The Ketchup song’s main chorus
